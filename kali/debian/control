Description: Asynchronous stateless TCP/UDP scanner with Alicorn web UI
 Unicornscan is a high-performance asynchronous stateless TCP/IP scanner
 designed for large-scale network reconnaissance. It provides superior speed
 and accuracy through its userland distributed TCP/IP stack implementation.
 .
 Key features:
  - Asynchronous stateless TCP scanning with all TCP flag variations
  - Asynchronous stateless TCP banner grabbing
  - Protocol-specific UDP scanning with signature-based responses
  - Active and passive OS/application fingerprinting
  - Compound scan modes (-mA+T, -mA+U) for ARP-filtered scanning
  - MAC address capture for local network targets
  - PCAP file logging and filtering
  - PostgreSQL database output with full schema
  - Custom module support and extensible architecture
 .
 This version includes the Alicorn Web UI:
  - React-based interface for visualizing scan results
  - ASN/CIDR hierarchical grouping in topology view
  - Multi-scan comparison with diff exports
  - GeoIP integration for IP geolocation
  - Real-time scan monitoring via PostgREST API
 .
 Docker services (started via unicornscan-alicorn):
  - PostgreSQL 16 for scan data storage
  - PostgREST for REST API access
  - GeoIP API for live IP lookups
  - Nginx serving the React frontend
