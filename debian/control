Description: Asynchronous stateless TCP/UDP network scanner
 Unicornscan is an asynchronous network scanner designed for
 scalable, accurate, and flexible port scanning. It separates
 the sending and receiving of packets into separate processes
 for maximum performance.
 .
 Features include:
  - Asynchronous stateless TCP scanning with full banner grabbing
  - Asynchronous UDP scanning with custom payloads
  - ARP scanning for local network discovery
  - OS fingerprinting via p0f v3 integration
  - PostgreSQL database export
  - Configurable packet rates up to millions of PPS
 .
 This package includes the Alicorn web UI for viewing scan results.
 To start the web interface, run: unicornscan-alicorn start
 (Requires Docker - install with: apt install docker.io)
